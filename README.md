# Predicting Stroke in Health Patients
## ADS503 - Team 7 - group project

Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. It is also a leading cause of disability 
â€“ more than half the survivors over 65 years of age have reduced mobility. While it is a deadly and 
debilitating disease, the effects can be limited if acted early upon (American Heart Association). 
The goal of this project is to understand what causes stroke and provide a guide for patients that worry 
about their chance of stroke later in life or even currently. If a model that accurately predicts stroke, 
in an interpretable fashion, that would give our doctors strong assistance in identifying 
which patients of theirs are at risk and learn how to limit the chances of having a stroke. Ultimately, 
the factors like age, hypertension, and average glucose level have the largest impact on stroke 
occuring. Predicting stroke with machine learning algorithms with interpretable and explainable results
Built many models like naive bayes, penalized logistic regression, logistic regression with multiple 
different approaches to find a way to accurately predict stroke. Focused on limiting false negatives 
and ensuring results are interpretable to some degree.Models were built off health record data like age, 
gender, bmi, smoking status, glucose level, presence of hypertension and heart disease
